[2024-01-05 18:44:11+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: :(
[2024-01-05 18:44:16+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: No event today, I've passed away
[2024-01-05 18:44:22+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: NO WAIT
[2024-01-05 18:44:36+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh, I got better
[2024-01-05 18:44:47+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this white mage can pump out so much healing,
[2024-01-05 18:45:06+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: it's free heal estate
[2024-01-05 18:47:21+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i hated that

[2024-01-05 18:52:05+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cain's reflex to MOVE is apt
[2024-01-05 18:54:03+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Adra and smaller Adra

[2024-01-05 18:58:05+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: A fish.
[2024-01-05 18:58:08+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: thats the red among us imposter
[2024-01-05 18:58:13+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: a damaged bisexual
[2024-01-05 18:58:18+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: sus
[2024-01-05 18:58:26+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: a damaged bisexual and also sus
[2024-01-05 18:59:46+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: what is happening..... the scandal
[2024-01-05 19:00:08+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  *TPs in, sees this* I have a headache, I will go :P
[2024-01-05 19:00:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this is the triforce they've been talking about
[2024-01-05 19:00:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: punch punching punches
[2024-01-05 19:00:16+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LOL
[2024-01-05 19:00:21+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: NO STAY
[2024-01-05 19:00:26+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: exhaustion, will not die, and spite
[2024-01-05 19:00:33+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: And here I thought Sven would find Adra punching people somehow... alluring
[2024-01-05 19:00:35+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: the three pieces of the tri-fight
[2024-01-05 19:00:53+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I feel like Adra would have some magitek for that
[2024-01-05 19:01:17+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: adra comes in rocking punch gauntlets like Vi Leauge of Legends
[2024-01-05 19:01:31+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Just a mechanical hand that shoots out of her shirt pocket and slaps people?
[2024-01-05 19:01:42+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I can see that.
[2024-01-05 19:02:17+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Utilising toaster spring technology
[2024-01-05 19:02:19+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I am feeling one of those present boxes
[2024-01-05 19:02:50+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: vengeance will be mine
[2024-01-05 19:03:10+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ah look who it is
[2024-01-05 19:03:24+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: You're not allowed in the party I'm afraid
[2024-01-05 19:03:32+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: WHAT?
[2024-01-05 19:03:52+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: by vote of democracy
[2024-01-05 19:03:55+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: You have to be this tall etc etc.
[2024-01-05 19:03:57+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: But you can join the RP I guess (adra's apaaatomento)
[2024-01-05 19:04:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i will brb
[2024-01-05 19:05:20+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Gonna make a start once Yoki is here
[2024-01-05 19:05:27+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Tha- t'd be now
[2024-01-05 19:05:34+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i didnt realize we were roleplaying in silent hill
[2024-01-05 19:05:57+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: which famously is based on the real american town of centralia
[2024-01-05 19:06:26+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: dwight voice: FALSE
[2024-01-05 19:06:28+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Yeah, I heard that from some very reliable influencers once
[2024-01-05 19:06:41+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: centraliallover deez nuts
[2024-01-05 19:06:43+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im a verified silent hill scholar, inever played a silent hill game
[2024-01-05 19:07:10+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Well, if you play it you're just a gamer, and you're an ACADEMIC
[2024-01-05 19:07:12+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh man
[2024-01-05 19:07:26+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yeah im not a real gamer i only play visual novels
[2024-01-05 19:07:43+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i saw a video essay on one based on the werewolf board game recently, that seemed... like a mess, but interesting
[2024-01-05 19:07:44+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Which is more of an experience, really
[2024-01-05 19:07:59+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i'm a professional gamer
[2024-01-05 19:08:03+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: literally. unfortunately
[2024-01-05 19:08:31+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im an unprofessional gamer, i dont sign off any of my kills with Kind regards,
[2024-01-05 19:08:33+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: my new drinking game is taking a shot every time a VN brings up time travel as a plot point or 'replaying events'
[2024-01-05 19:08:36+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: If you speedrun a Visual Novel, does that count as professional gaming?
[2024-01-05 19:08:40+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: It's all clicks at the end of the day.
[2024-01-05 19:08:51+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Raging Loop fucking sucks
[2024-01-05 19:08:57+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i didn't need that video to tell me but
[2024-01-05 19:09:04+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i had tried streaming it after i streamed gnosia
[2024-01-05 19:09:08+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: gnosia = incredible
[2024-01-05 19:09:09+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: the shrine maiden was cute
[2024-01-05 19:09:13+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: people do absolutely speedrun visual novels, yes
[2024-01-05 19:09:15+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: raging loop = what if i gouged my eyes out
[2024-01-05 19:09:44+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: People speedrun making grilled cheese. Is that professional gaming?
[2024-01-05 19:09:45+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i'd suggest we should do IC werewolf (secret voidsent?) but selfishly, i know yoki would be KO'd immediately
[2024-01-05 19:09:57+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: omg what if we played secret garlean
[2024-01-05 19:10:08+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: .... looks at sven
[2024-01-05 19:10:47+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i used to play mafia IC like. constantly when i was 14-15
[2024-01-05 19:10:51+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That suggestion at game night would generate a pretty thick, awkward silence.
[2024-01-05 19:10:52+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Do it.
[2024-01-05 19:11:05+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I ran werewolf basically every weekend for a few years in college >.>
[2024-01-05 19:11:06+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Previously, the Unsung managed to disable Yuyuno's scorpion tank and subdue her. She was pulled from the mech and cuffed, and the decision was made to bring her along. There was no going back; not without trying to crack open more than one reinforced blast door. Though the arena they had fought in presented with no viable route forward, damage sustained by the walls during the battle revealed egress at the far end of the room, allowing them to proceed. -
[2024-01-05 19:11:13+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yes, Charlette
[2024-01-05 19:11:22+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I am a professional gamer.
[2024-01-05 19:11:33+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I friggen KNEW it!
[2024-01-05 19:11:48+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: none of you are real gamers until you can name every color of pikmin
[2024-01-05 19:12:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: theyre the same as among us
[2024-01-05 19:12:21+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: we should do some unsung game nights
[2024-01-05 19:12:25+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: almost, one is polkadot
[2024-01-05 19:12:31+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: polkadot isnt in amoogus
[2024-01-05 19:12:40+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Which reminds me, I should order pikmin 4
[2024-01-05 19:12:44+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: it could be..
[2024-01-05 19:12:55+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Hey, guys, there's a lot of bad roleplay and bad roleplayers ou there, and roleplaying to frustrate eachother just is not cool
[2024-01-05 19:13:18+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: BRO SBNUHHTU UP
[2024-01-05 19:13:21+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: SHUT UP DUDE
[2024-01-05 19:13:29+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Im here, I'm holding your hand right now
[2024-01-05 19:13:36+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im going to commit a fucking crime
[2024-01-05 19:13:56+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Having no context is always fun
[2024-01-05 19:14:05+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: mcelroy nonsense
[2024-01-05 19:14:08+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ^
[2024-01-05 19:14:14+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: you're better off not knowing tbh fam
[2024-01-05 19:14:33+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i dont wanna be Dipshit546 i can link it after the rp if you want but it is hatercore
[2024-01-05 19:14:56+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: shitposting i can accept but let's not drown our adra emotes with mcelroy lore. at least not yet
[2024-01-05 19:15:06+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Adra, with the help of anyone willing to lend a little brute force to the effort, managed to leverage it open and allowed them to progress. The corridor ahead proved treacherous, with segments of the floor and walls missing or out of alignment, as if they'd only been half-built. The steady pulse of aether thrummed in their ears like a heartbeat. It wouldn't have been bearable to stop and investigate for long. When they emerged, they found themselves at something of a dead end, with -
[2024-01-05 19:18:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i used to play mafia with cohhcarnage for a little bit, and used to run IRC werewolf and such; great times
[2024-01-05 19:18:25+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - hastily-erected defenses barricading the door forward. Above them, on a platform guarded by barbed wire and stakes formed from twisted metal beams with sharp edges that jutted forward. They could see- and easily hear the startled murmur of more than a handful of figures huddled up above behind the defenses, shifting into place. The barrels of rifles trained aim on the Unsung... but no shots were fired, yet.
[2024-01-05 19:19:52+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  lets out a brief: "Shite," when he hears the shuffling, but visibly relaxes when there's no fire. Very slowly, he takes his mask off - almost as a sign of good faith - and mumbles: "Farsent, maybe?"
[2024-01-05 19:19:57+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_3: Celica was positioned near the front of the group, shield at the ready to throw up into the path of any shot bullets. But she looks tired, shaking her head at the sight. She says nothing, figuring a different member of the Unsung will probably have more things to say.
[2024-01-05 19:20:08+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Okhi'to moved to Charlette's flank, subtly nodding in her direction.
[2024-01-05 19:20:20+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cillenne- Cillenne wasn't beside them anymore.
[2024-01-05 19:20:42+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cillenne's our illusionist, right?
[2024-01-05 19:20:55+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Ye! If you're looking for them, lemme know
[2024-01-05 19:21:04+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  murmurs quietly about not really wanting to get shot today. Or any day of the week, really, but not today in particular.
[2024-01-05 19:21:04+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: "We have one of your own! Stand dow…" She had turned to Yuyuno mid-command to find Cillenne missing, to her dismay.
[2024-01-05 19:21:12+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: Redgar regards the empty spot where Cillenne was, mumbling a faint: "Deflinitely farsent."
[2024-01-05 19:21:17+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: red is gonna look
[2024-01-05 19:21:42+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  kept his eye on Yuyu, making sure the engineer didn't run off or activate something nasty at the earliest oppertunity. He also checked in with Cill, and studied the dynamic between the two, if there was any. He had his shield ready when they found themselves the target of firearms yet again, but let the others do the talking for now.
[2024-01-05 19:22:34+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  has been tense ever since stepping into the half-finished corridoors, and what awaits the group after only makes his jaw tighten even more. He grips his staff and looks around, noticing Cillenne's disappearance, and then spends a moment focusing on aether of the room.
[2024-01-05 19:22:41+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  does what she usually does in the face of danger: offers the sweetest smile she can muster. Nobody can shoot someone smiling so nicely. (Nine times out of ten.)
[2024-01-05 19:23:03+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  that oppressive aether they passed through before had left Charlette a little slow in her wits. She had stopped to investigate, much as she could, but eventually felt too sick to remain. So when she pushes through with the rest into the room and comes face-to-face with the barricade and the rifles above, she opens her book a tad slowly as she attempts to throw-up a barrier between the Unsung and those many rifles. "Careful!"
[2024-01-05 19:24:00+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: "Clearly, neither of us want to fight." She gestures to the barrier that's been thrown up. "See?"
[2024-01-05 19:24:16+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath TellRecieve: MSG
[2024-01-05 19:24:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: For as long as they'd been there to observe, Cillenne hadn't said much of a word to Yuyuno. The two of them had regarded one another with looks of familiarity, but the wildwood had kept their distance once Yuyuno was in chains. The lalafell was quiet, her head bowed. She briefly raised it to assess the situation, frowning.
[2024-01-05 19:26:49+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The winds stirred by Sven and Red, and a gentler brand of aether tickled the senses of those who were sensitive to such. As the presence passed through the group, a material figure arose, his shoulders squared, his scarred face staring up unflinching as he stepped into the centre of the room, beyond the safety of Charlette's barriers. -
[2024-01-05 19:27:03+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cadmus.
[2024-01-05 19:27:25+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: NOT THIS PRICK
[2024-01-05 19:27:46+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath TellSend: MSG
[2024-01-05 19:27:47+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: guys
[2024-01-05 19:27:51+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: like
[2024-01-05 19:27:59+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: what if cill was cadmus all along?
[2024-01-05 19:28:06+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: top ten fucking anime betrayals
[2024-01-05 19:28:08+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Have you ever seen them in a room together?
[2024-01-05 19:28:44+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: No, thank gods
[2024-01-05 19:28:57+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  lets out a long and weary sigh. "Finally. Yer harder to get an audience with than the bloody Syndicate."
[2024-01-05 19:29:27+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cadmus is too sigma to be seen with anyone.
[2024-01-05 19:29:44+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: stay back, everyone! he's on his grindset!
[2024-01-05 19:29:46+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: He stood with his back to the Unsung, adopting a confident, relaxed posture at ease. "Farsent," he began, ignoring the Unsung behind him. A few of the figures stirred behind their defences, some peeking through the barricade.
[2024-01-05 19:29:51+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: dear GOD
[2024-01-05 19:29:51+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cadmus is sigma AF
[2024-01-05 19:29:58+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  , wary and perhaps against her better judgment, retrieves her weapon slowly but surely the closer Cadmus gets to the group.
[2024-01-05 19:30:05+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "Are you fucking *kidding* me."
[2024-01-05 19:30:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: To note:
[2024-01-05 19:30:07+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  does the rubbing his nose thing while simultaniously speaking - very softly- into the linkpearl on his ring. <"That's Cill, play along.">
[2024-01-05 19:30:11+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: He came FROM us
[2024-01-05 19:30:20+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: He passed by us to walk to the front of the group
[2024-01-05 19:30:22+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ^
[2024-01-05 19:30:37+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: sorry, i misunderstood/m,isread
[2024-01-05 19:30:39+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  hears Sven's words a moment later - and he manages to keep his poker face. But it's tough.
[2024-01-05 19:30:46+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ill shut up haha
[2024-01-05 19:30:58+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sorry if that was unclear! But yes he walked out past Charlette from the midst of the Unsung
[2024-01-05 19:31:00+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: no need, just wanted to clarify cause i think a few of us got Blindsided by post
[2024-01-05 19:31:02+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Ohhh, ignore Red's statement then!
[2024-01-05 19:31:14+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Kickass move from Cill
[2024-01-05 19:31:29+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YES BUT WHAT IF CILL NEVER EXISTED
[2024-01-05 19:32:00+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  stays almost so still that he could be a statue. He stares at Cadmus but seems more attentive than wary; perhaps even a notch less tense than before.
[2024-01-05 19:32:09+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  looked as confused as the rest, mostly by the direction of the aether buffeting at her skirts and senses. Godo thing she usually goes quiet when trying to figure out a puzzle, then Sven beats her to the conclusion. How annoying. "I do not like this..."
[2024-01-05 19:32:31+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  has only ever moved to stand in between gun barrels and her group, her gaze still impassive as she looks up at the gleam of every weapon as it is trained onto them. She stares at Cadmus—she seems to grasp the situation, but it just makes her /more/ tense, rather than less.
[2024-01-05 19:32:40+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ill still have imogen unsheathing her weapon since it might increase the Intimidation Check
[2024-01-05 19:33:01+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: brb!
[2024-01-05 19:33:57+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: "As you can tell," he speaks up, only forgetting to turn his pearl off midway through his sentence - poor ears, "We have come to an understanding. Right decurion?"
[2024-01-05 19:34:05+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: "Come with us. We need to evacuate the facility." He raised his arm, gesturing to the Unsung with a glance over his epaulet. "They are here to assist. We've lost power in parts of the facility and their engineers are devising a path forward." The Unsung had never heard Cadmus' voice before... but the voice they heard sounded nothing like Cillenne's, at least. The Farsent murmured behind their barricades.
[2024-01-05 19:34:55+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  also tries to shoot Yuyu the type of look that promises ever-lasting suffering if they speak up to the contrary. It might be effective, it might hilarious, who knows?
[2024-01-05 19:35:07+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "We en't ever been here to hurt anybody - I know we had our scraps, but I should point out we didn't go fer any kills. Those among you we harmed are still standin' - an' that was very much on purpose."
[2024-01-05 19:35:19+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: "D… Despite what happened, we're not inclined to leave you here to die," Imogen tries to carry the lie forward.
[2024-01-05 19:35:47+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Okhi'to's still here, right?
[2024-01-05 19:36:03+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Yuyuno blinked owlishly. She was scowling in utter disbelief, dramatically glancing at her own hands, bound behind her back. "You got to be fucking kidding me," she whispered, mindful of Sven's look.
[2024-01-05 19:36:07+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: He is!
[2024-01-05 19:36:12+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Poor Fern with their 3 friggin NPCs and a bunch of farsent now, haha
[2024-01-05 19:36:41+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  nods to Okhi'to, then. "I gave this bloke my word, and I intend to keep it."
[2024-01-05 19:37:25+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  grumbles quietly, arms crossed. She sucks a breath, eager to add in a witty one-liner of her own. But instead, she just huffs. "I'm still annoyed about the books."
[2024-01-05 19:38:10+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  can't help but chuckle a bit, though he manages to keep it low and brief. He closes his eye at Yuyu - maybe he was winking, then stepped aside so the Farsent could pass through. If that happens to block Yuyu from sight for the most part... well, happy accidents.
[2024-01-05 19:38:16+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Okhi'to stepped forward from Charlette's side, trying to body-block sight of Yuyuno as best he could. "Farsent - Cadmus speaks true. We've a mind to get you all out of here. It isn't safe. Come with us, please. The Unsung, those behind us, they are our allies and they mean no harm. Please lay down arms," he urged.
[2024-01-05 19:39:00+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  follows Sven's lead and steps aside, her polearm stowed away. For now.
[2024-01-05 19:39:09+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  makes a preliminary move to stow her weapon, but her shield remains at the ready.
[2024-01-05 19:39:38+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  lowers his weapon and turns his attention to the people behind the barricade, eyeing their reactions and general state as much as he is able to through the obstacles and anything else obscuring the vision.
[2024-01-05 19:40:03+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Back! Catching-up!
[2024-01-05 19:40:47+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh shit, I -just- noticed the redesigned room
[2024-01-05 19:40:50+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i'm observant
[2024-01-05 19:41:27+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  continues her bold smile tactics, assured in its effectiveness. Mostly.
[2024-01-05 19:41:28+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Nura was the first to rise. She pressed herself against the rails and looked over, a blade in her hand, a pistol holstered. She stared intently at the pair before the Unsung... and vaulted down, landing a fulm or few ahead of them on the ground. "Cadmus? Okhi'to..." She looked none the worse for wear, if a little unwell. Okhi'to smiled with clear relief. "Please," he insisted, moving to clear a path.
[2024-01-05 19:42:44+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: -The doors towards the back rattled open. A masked, suited figure stepped forward, lifting the gate behind Nura and letting it clatter shut behind her. -
[2024-01-05 19:42:52+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  even -reclines- against the wall, exuding an air of tiredness and relief. Most of it's genuine, being fair. He gives Luca a thumbs up, good smiling, girl.
[2024-01-05 19:43:33+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: "What in the hells is going on here?" she asked. Nothing moved but her mouth.
[2024-01-05 19:44:05+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: does she got miqo'te ears
[2024-01-05 19:44:13+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: See discord
[2024-01-05 19:44:17+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh
[2024-01-05 19:44:49+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "We're gettin' your people out unharmed," Red quips back, gesturing to Fake!Cadmus. "Cap'ns orders."
[2024-01-05 19:44:54+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: https://empireembers.crd.co/#bio
[2024-01-05 19:44:56+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  retains her position, though shuffles a little out of the way, keeping her barrier up as 'Cadmus' makes his play. When Nura leaps down and the second figure appears though, she steps forward, the barrier moving with her and ilming closer. Hopefully easier to step behind and into if need be. It's unsubtle, fueled by nerves she cannot calm.
[2024-01-05 19:45:46+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  peers curiously at the gate that opens and closes, and the person who steps up makes him narrow his eyes a little. He somehow manages to keep his weapon down, but tension is back in his shoulders.
[2024-01-05 19:46:37+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  narrows her eyes lightly at the new arrival. She... well, she may be masked. But she checks for miqo'te ears.
[2024-01-05 19:46:48+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: 'Cadmus' and Okhi'to turned their gazes towards the new arrival. Nura moved aside to make room for her. "I've given the order to evacuate. Everyone is to leave. That means you as well... J'nairoh." Cadmus' voice was steady, authoritative. J'nairoh lifted her head to appraise her commanding officer.
[2024-01-05 19:47:04+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  whistled low, he was still Sven after all. "You'd look good in that," he said with a nod to cyborg miqo'te, speaking to... well everyone in the room it seemed. Despite his joking demeanor, he's stepping forward, getting close to 'Cadmus' just in case someone needs a shield soon.
[2024-01-05 19:47:53+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  grits her teeth in silence. She does not step forward with Sven, but it's clear she's poised to leap to the front line in the event that things go south as a result of the new arrival. Her expression turns all the more severe.
[2024-01-05 19:48:21+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: "I just spoke to you downstairs. How did you..." Her jaw fell slack. She looked to the Unsung. "If you're here, then who's... wait."
[2024-01-05 19:48:51+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ah crud
[2024-01-05 19:48:54+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: that's a high number
[2024-01-05 19:49:06+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: could be CILL's bluff
[2024-01-05 19:49:13+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: true
[2024-01-05 19:49:20+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: She has a tactical nuke in her back pocket.
[2024-01-05 19:51:22+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cadmus' expression was unchanged, stony. There was no crack in his facade. Okhi'to said nothing beside him- his brow crumpled slightly. Nura... Nura looked dreadfully confused, but obviously daren't ask the question on her mind with the tension so thick-
[2024-01-05 19:53:05+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: J'nairoh... laughed. It was the only warning they got. She was behind Cadmus in a flash, too quick by half. She issued a kick to the back of his knees, wrapped her arm around his throat before he'd fallen to them.
[2024-01-05 19:53:56+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The blade of her fists grazed 'his' throat. "Drop the illusion," she snarled.
[2024-01-05 19:54:04+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - And we are now in combat.
[2024-01-05 19:54:20+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  doesn't move from his perch, but he growls out a low, rumbling: "Easy." Black as midnight and tense as distant thunder - but it might be too late.
[2024-01-05 19:54:35+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: https://empireembers.crd.co/#combat for rulez btw
[2024-01-05 19:54:57+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: "Does the decurion really need to repeat himself? Orders were given, we... She is betraying her commander," he called out as he tried to bodily block her, probably to no avail. He has a hand on his gunblade, but doesn't shoot. "Let him go," he growls.
[2024-01-05 19:55:00+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YES thank you, so- for a quick review, not much has changed you don't already mostly know
[2024-01-05 19:55:51+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: ((no roll, since he's not attacking yet))
[2024-01-05 19:56:45+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: why do i gotta be in the path of a rampaging squirrel.
[2024-01-05 19:57:00+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (this is very cool)
[2024-01-05 19:57:11+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Groupwide barriers are already in effect - that's 1000 to begin with. Those who contributed (just Charlette I imagine) forfeit this round. If you have a personal barrier, it's a free action to throw it up. Charlette (and others) can refresh groupwides every 4 turns. Personals, every 3. Groupwide costs your turn, personals don't. 250 HP for personals.
[2024-01-05 19:58:02+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I know we've been playing with Bunshin as a one-hit soak but I'm happy for it to count as a personal barrier if it's ezier
[2024-01-05 19:58:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: how would we rule divine veil VS passage of arms, ie. an actual barrier/shield VS "i'm just gonna sit here and block for people"
[2024-01-05 19:58:54+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: there are a lot of people here competent at Hit Person with Big Stick and i feel like Celica neatly slots into "make sure the people who need protection get it" so i may stick with my niche
[2024-01-05 19:59:46+00:00] Cain Locke Say: "Gods damn it," Cain curses between his teeth and raises his weapon. When a quick glance reveals that his comrades - or at least some of them - have opted for persuasion rather than attacking, he stays his hand, too, albeit a faint violet energy starts to build up onto the tip of his staff. "Let him go, J'nairoh." (No roll this round)
[2024-01-05 20:00:36+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  lurches back as J'nairoh jets forward, stumbling slightly over her own feet and slow reactions, but her barrier is pulled back and the wall breaks down in hundreds of shards. All of them fly backward and start to form barriers around all of the Unsung, Okhi'to and Yuyuno and Cillienne. J'nairoh, however, is too close and won't be stopped by Charlette's efforts. (Groupwide Shield)
[2024-01-05 20:00:41+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Groupwide barriers contribute to and cap out at 1000 HP for the sake of balance, but for flava you can play them out as you see fit. I'd say she could 'cover' (or block 1 hit) for individuals per turn if that's what she'll be doing.
[2024-01-05 20:01:03+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: works for me!
[2024-01-05 20:01:07+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  doesn't bother with facades anymore; she doesn't like them, for one, and the ambient aether is thrumming too strongly for her to want to play mind games right now. She leaps forward from her place and swings her polearm in a large arc over her head, a glimmering halo in low light — and sends it crashing into the target on the back of J'NAIROH's crown.
[2024-01-05 20:02:27+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Imogen really be like: Cowabunga it is
[2024-01-05 20:02:43+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That's what Imogen needs.
[2024-01-05 20:02:46+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: A skateboard.
[2024-01-05 20:02:55+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LOL god i can imagine
[2024-01-05 20:04:07+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: "You assumptions are garbage and your adherence to the system makes me revile you." *Dons backward cap and ollies into the horizon*
[2024-01-05 20:04:10+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: There was a chorus of clicks and clacks from above as the Farsent readied their weapons, but the sheer chaos of the situation and the lack of commands or anyone willing to give them saw them staying their hands. Yuyuno shuffled as far back and away from the fighting as she could, but anyone paying her any mind could see her eyeing up the back corridor with obvious intent to flee.
[2024-01-05 20:04:27+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  pushes off the wall, and suddenly there's two of him. He was using that time leant against it to master his breathing and create it, though he looks -ragged-. It's unlikely he's gonna be doing that again for the rest of the brawl. (Personal barrier, 250, though I think it's the only one Red gets since he's been through a -lot- today). "Be -sensible- about -" and then Imogen's going in, so he sighs, turning to the remaining Farsent: "We -don't- want to hurt anybody, you cutters saw! -
[2024-01-05 20:04:49+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: - Lay yer weapons down and no harm'll come to you, we swear!"
[2024-01-05 20:05:15+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Red's trying to do A Persuade to get them to surrender, or at the very least like - keep them confused for a turn.
[2024-01-05 20:05:19+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  [Random]!  [652] 
[2024-01-05 20:07:05+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  growls out, "I send you amenities, and don't even have it accreddited to me. I try to make for pleasant conversation, and get rebuked. I'm -sure- I'm about to be shot at, but I'm not going to be the one to initiate this." Low to the ground, she turns her gaze towards the engineer. "And -you're- not going to scamper off to get some -death machine- to -further- ruin -my- day." She glowers. "Are. We. C l e a r?" Her ornate rod is brandished.
[2024-01-05 20:07:07+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Okhi'to staggered back as J'nairoh struck. "Wait, what are you doing?" he hissed at her. "Let him go!" There was very real fear in his eyes though- even before Imogen lunged. Sensing the Farsent's ambivalence, he threw his hat into the ring to aid with Red's efforts. "Hold your fire!"
[2024-01-05 20:07:31+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: that is the most frightening shit yoki has said
[2024-01-05 20:07:37+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: dear g o d
[2024-01-05 20:07:46+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: GETTEM YOKI
[2024-01-05 20:12:52+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (Celica and Luca lemme know if you're doing a thing or I missed it)
[2024-01-05 20:13:05+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i was waiting on Luca tbh
[2024-01-05 20:13:41+00:00] Luca Myste CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ack, sorry
[2024-01-05 20:14:23+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath Emote:  navigated to the rear of their formation, her eye on Yuyuno. When Yoki stepped in to threaten her though, the engineer left her to it and instead began to fiddle with a magitek device strapped to her gauntlet.
[2024-01-05 20:14:37+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  grits her teeth and steps forward to join Redgar, arms splayed out to the sides, expression open. Her shield remains strapped to her back now. Why not? If any of them were going to bet on diplomacy, she was sure as hell intending to join in. That said... she does position herself such that if J'nairoh is to strike, she can get involved immediately after. "I'll lead you if need be; come!"
[2024-01-05 20:14:39+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Adra playing angry birds
[2024-01-05 20:14:50+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 884 Persuasion Attempt
[2024-01-05 20:15:04+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  rests a hand on her sword hilt, caught between moving decisively or waiting to see what comes off the attempts of persuasion; and so simply remains ready for now.
[2024-01-05 20:15:49+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I didn't roll for persuasion before, didn't think we'd roll for that, but maybe I missed something?
[2024-01-05 20:16:10+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i saw red do it and i am, if nothing else, emboldened by the actions of others
[2024-01-05 20:16:38+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: If you want to, you can. Checks for the Farsent will be different from those against J'nairoh, though.
[2024-01-05 20:17:00+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Red's done a 652 of word damage against the Farsent
[2024-01-05 20:17:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Epic rap battles of history
[2024-01-05 20:18:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I'm not going to give each party a numerical value to 'beat' for persuasion per se but I'll factor it in along with the content of the persuasion as well as how many people are making the attempt, if they're undermining one another's arguments, etc. for some clarity on how I'd handle it
[2024-01-05 20:20:26+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: You mean Charlette can't convince the Farsent to give-up on this with a snippy line like "Magitek is whack, the Elementals got your back. Wiggety-wiggety surrender or be apprehended..."
[2024-01-05 20:21:08+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I think at that point, everyone is just gonna give up
[2024-01-05 20:21:22+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That's a win tho
[2024-01-05 20:21:26+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: We'll be like 'let's just get drunk together because that was painful'
[2024-01-05 20:21:34+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Fair, yeah, it'll get the job done
[2024-01-05 20:21:39+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: they call her yung dorky
[2024-01-05 20:21:46+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Charlette doesn't need friends anyway.
[2024-01-05 20:21:51+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: "We're suing for surrender, the Unsung's bold, while your little bitch-boy Cadmus is all Garle-mald."
[2024-01-05 20:21:56+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: She has her book and potted plants.
[2024-01-05 20:22:06+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I can see Charlette making PSAs like that for real
[2024-01-05 20:22:28+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 'dont be a thug, but you can do Some drugs' - charlette probably
[2024-01-05 20:22:56+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 'It's only drugs if the Elementals don't approve'
[2024-01-05 20:22:56+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: A series of posters just start appearing on the CETEA about getting STI checks. Red helps with the slang and Imogen helps rip them down and draw facial hair on the models.
[2024-01-05 20:23:15+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2:  Cadmus struggled, Cillenne retained his visage, but J'nairoh held fast and applied enough pressure to draw blood- right up until the moment that Imogen was upon her, polearm poised. Then, she kicked Cadmus forward onto hands and knees, bounding backward out of Imogen's path with frighteningly swift reflexes. She found herself at Okhi'to's side, shooting him a wary look. Reaching behind her back, she unclipped a pair of smooth devices and pressed them into his hand. -
[2024-01-05 20:23:16+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: shes just mad bc she doesnt get any
[2024-01-05 20:23:28+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: tru
[2024-01-05 20:25:42+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: "We got this if you cover me. I'll forgive- whatever this was, and I won't hurt them... much." Okhi'to started to shake his head and retort, but she was gone before he could speak, leaving him with a set of magitek nouliths in his hand, and the question of what he'd do hanging in the air. -
[2024-01-05 20:28:06+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: And then she was upon Imogen again, a grey blur against the drab steel of the facility's rusting backdrop. A fluid flurry of blows rained down against the shielded lancer. One, two, then a solid kick aimed to shove her back into the Unsung's midst if her initial strikes did as she hoped. (3 hits, IMOGEN) -
[2024-01-05 20:28:18+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Ouch
[2024-01-05 20:28:21+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ay ay ay
[2024-01-05 20:29:00+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: jjeZUS
[2024-01-05 20:29:04+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Seems like RNG agrees with J'nairoh being a danger
[2024-01-05 20:29:08+00:00] Luca Myste CrossWorldLinkShell_1: imogen will be missed
[2024-01-05 20:29:19+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: mist*
[2024-01-05 20:29:26+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LOL
[2024-01-05 20:29:38+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  moved to help Cadmus up and get him behind him as he put his magitek shield up. He shot Okhi'to a look as the man was tested, but didn't bother to talk him out of anything or even defend himself against him. It seemed like Sven was going to trust the man and didn't bother worrying about what might happen if the medicus changed his mind. "She's gone off the rails," he called out, maintaining the facade that she was the one betrying Cadmus for as long as he could. "Permission to shoot," he --
[2024-01-05 20:30:18+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: -- asked 'Cadmus' as he took the safety off his gunblade with an audible 'click'.  ((shield: 1250))
[2024-01-05 20:30:35+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: sorry, I missed the - there, will wait to see if I need to adjust my post
[2024-01-05 20:32:32+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Up above, the Farsent stood paralysed by the chaos. It seemed that their efforts to talk them down had at least caused enough confusion to bring a standstill to their support, leaving J'nairoh to fight this one alone. Yuyuno was stopped in her tracks by Yoki - primarily by being caught in the act at all, but something about her fellow lalafell's bearing made her pause and click her tongue. "What a damned mess," she hoarsely growled, pausing. "Fine."
[2024-01-05 20:32:47+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: np, nothing to adjust for
[2024-01-05 20:32:54+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  | In the middle of her first strike, Imogen looks back at her fellow Unsung with great, dark disbelief. Her expression, shrouded beneath a grid of flickering light, casts frightening shadows that conceal as much as they emphasise. Then Imogen turns away. She's hit square in the chest by J'nairoh. The second hit shatters her shield into fragments. The last slams her into the wall— >>
[2024-01-05 20:32:55+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Go ahead
[2024-01-05 20:32:59+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: >>As she's pushed away, She tries — with great difficulty (disadvantage) to hook the beak of her weapon into the convenient nook between J'NAIROH's blade and her arm and yank back, so as to trip the woman forward — to take her down with her. It's her last effort, as she feels the aetherial thrum lull her into a bitter unconsciousness… (-1039/1000)
[2024-01-05 20:33:20+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: (194 final roll)
[2024-01-05 20:33:37+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: was that with disadvantage? lmfao
[2024-01-05 20:33:43+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  has been preparing his spell, and when Imogen is kicked back towards them, he releases the aether as a Sleep spell, directed at J'NAIROH, before conjuring a shimmering ward around him atop Charlette's barrier. (Shield: 1250)
[2024-01-05 20:33:51+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yep!!
[2024-01-05 20:34:15+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I think we didn't sacrifice enough to the dice gods recently
[2024-01-05 20:35:36+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: its kinda POETIC though
[2024-01-05 20:35:36+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  has to think quickly. Imogen looks like she's been dropped almost immediately, and Cain is casting a spell—but she isn't sure of the results. She shoots a nervous glance to Red—if he goes to help Imogen, she'll remain where she is to keep convincing. But if Red stays the course, someone needs to engage J'nairoh, and she is ready.
[2024-01-05 20:35:47+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: cel is gonna wait for redgar to act and decide from there
[2024-01-05 20:36:00+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this is a very verbose way of saying "i am waiting on Red's decision"
[2024-01-05 20:36:05+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "You've -got- to -" Any suing for peace Red has is immediately torn away from him as Imogen gets -torn- into. Sudden panic seizes the hyur, and the frustration the typically zen man has been holding back bubbles to the surface in a surge of movement. "ENOUGH!" he roars, as both him and his bunshin streak towards J'NAIROH. Blades akimbo, attempting to dish out what she dealt against Imogen tenfold with all the violence of the butcher he once was. (1/2)
[2024-01-05 20:36:21+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "I am TIRED of you ARSEHOLES just lashing out at EVERYTHING!" Oh, he's engaging J'nairoh alright. (2/2)
[2024-01-05 20:36:41+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: well i mean. at least it's above 200
[2024-01-05 20:37:11+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  then steps forward to continue to try and mollify the Farsent. "Friends, please!
[2024-01-05 20:37:16+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: keyboard why
[2024-01-05 20:37:50+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: return of the return key
[2024-01-05 20:38:02+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  then steps forward to continue to try and mollify the Farsent. "Friends, please! We must not continue this. Come with me and allow us to escort you to safety! We will try to resolve this as quickly as we can, but we must away! I am begging you!" She does not reach for her shield. If they fire, the barrier and her armor are just going to have to do it.
[2024-01-05 20:38:16+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: if you want another persuasion i can but
[2024-01-05 20:38:42+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Quick question about barriers if you have a moment Fern.
[2024-01-05 20:38:49+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sure!
[2024-01-05 20:39:27+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  looks about wildly, her gaze caught between several different things all happening at once. Though she's far from a healer, she is a budding alchemist, and decides to make her way towards Imogen to see if she can support what will doubtlessly be an actual medic. As she passes, she extends a small gust of wind from her attuned rings, billowing Redgar's cape a bit to make him look cooler.
[2024-01-05 20:39:35+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Am I able to apply personal shields to others, or is just to myself and all I can do for others is groupwide? I'm looking at the rules and can't find specifics, though I might just be blind and/or dumb and just missing it.
[2024-01-05 20:42:16+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That'd fall under personal shield rules, which are fine to affect other players instead of yourself. I could probably clarify those a bit better so I'll look into doing that later. But as all Charlette will be doing is shielding, it might be fair to say she could do that every turn to the tune of 75? If my math is correct that more or less balances out.
[2024-01-05 20:42:46+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Well, it's a bit more but she is a shield specialist so I'll give it a pass.
[2024-01-05 20:43:10+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Oki doki! If it gets out of hand, just let me know and I'll do something else.
[2024-01-05 20:43:32+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  has little time to react "Stop! Stop fighting! This place is not safe, it never was! We have to go!" she's partly adding her voice tothe persuasion attempt but also declaring a truth she believes. After all, the Elementals are watching. She swings her book towards Imogen as she's laid into, a barrier reforming around her as she crumples under the blows. "Get her off Imogen!" it will hopefully be enough to stop any attempted finale blow. (IMOGEN barriers +75)
[2024-01-05 20:46:46+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  gasps out "Immy!" involuntarily as the lancer makes towards her collission, and watches her slide into unconsciousness. She clutches her rod with two hands, uncertain as to how to properly react, staring at the actual 'healers' as they do their business. She steps slightly forward in her direction, but eventually pivots on a heel to glare at her fellow lalafell. "It is," she asserts. "And you're no help. So continue your mewling in the corner if you're going to be such a brat."
[2024-01-05 20:47:07+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Say: "I would say I don't know how many times we're going to come to blows at eachother -- but there's a definitive answer now. This is the last time. Kill us, face devestation, regardless of a Garlean's intentions. Be beaten back, and I don't know if we'll be able to get you all out before whatever is happening reaches its -explosive- conclusion. Maybe our conflict doesn't end before this facility blows up! -Work with us-, and we'll have no conflict because we are doing everything we can to hold -
[2024-01-05 20:47:11+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Say: back so you can live. Do you understand that? Do you want to live? Stop this utter -nonsense- with us flinging barbs at eachother, discard your pride, and value your lives! Let me refute your inner monologues about what outsiders think of you. Your lives -are valuable-. Please."
[2024-01-05 20:47:19+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: please pardon my wall of txt it got out of hand
[2024-01-05 20:47:27+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ill do a roll for persuasion so i can see a 1
[2024-01-05 20:47:28+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  [Random]!  [670] 
[2024-01-05 20:48:45+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That was a cool speech: it deserves a decent roll like that
[2024-01-05 20:48:53+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ^^^
[2024-01-05 20:48:56+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YEAH
[2024-01-05 20:48:57+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Agreed!!
[2024-01-05 20:48:57+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im loving how things are ramping up from everyone
[2024-01-05 20:49:05+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: T.T
[2024-01-05 20:49:06+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: go the fuck off yoki
[2024-01-05 20:50:40+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: contrasted immensely by 'walers and waterwheels' playing in the background for me
[2024-01-05 20:52:35+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I feel like, if Yoki was a character in a turn-based RPG she'd have a move called 'Pitch a tactical fit'.
[2024-01-05 20:52:37+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cadmus was helped to his feet and behind Sven. "J'nairoh, enough!" he barked, and the authenticity of Cillenne's impersonation was enough to make Okhi'to look over momentarily. He hesitated, but issued a nod- "Permission granted." J'nairoh was beyond convincing, though. The medicus activated the magitek he'd been given, imbuing them with his aether. He looked a little more at ease than he had since being detained by the Unsung. Turning to Nura, who hovered hesitantly at his side, he -
[2024-01-05 20:55:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: he constructed a barrier around her. "I've got you," he whispered, a little tenderly. "I have all of you. We need to get out of here. It isn't safe." She met his eyes- nodded once. "'Ki'to, the cubs are here." ...that made him pause, his eyes darting upward. "We'll get them out as well. I'll keep you all safe," he promised. The Unsung's pleas saw more than one rifle retracting from the barricades. They could see familiar figures rising behind the chain fence and iron -
[2024-01-05 20:56:03+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: c-c-c-cubs? ;-;
[2024-01-05 20:56:41+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: if a childe is harmed in this i will furiously destroy whoever laid hands upon them, so sayeth the girl with the hero complex
[2024-01-05 20:57:23+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - battlements - a short hyur with unkempt hair, the tall duskwight by his side, tucking a grenade back into her belt. Nura vaulted back up to the others, and Okhi'to armed his magitek in preparation. "Sven, Adra... I need a clear path out," he warned. -
[2024-01-05 20:58:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (The Unsung were told there were a few children with the Farsent just in case that got missed at the time)
[2024-01-05 20:59:33+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: idk why i didnt think they were HERE
[2024-01-05 20:59:44+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i remembered them being mentioned but stil aaa
[2024-01-05 21:00:04+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: name a more iconic duo than garlean officers and orphans
[2024-01-05 21:00:12+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: - gaius
[2024-01-05 21:00:17+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: where there is one, the other surely follows
[2024-01-05 21:00:22+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: what's worse than a gaerlean? *pulls away sticker*
[2024-01-05 21:00:25+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Redgar: A child.
[2024-01-05 21:02:07+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Redgar got his wish - J'nairoh's full attention, even as swerved and twisted to avoid his every blow after effortlessly disentangling herself from Imogen. She made avoiding him look easy, all too easy, as though she knew precisely where his blades were to land. The suit she wore didn't look like it'd resist much force, but he wasn't to be the one to put that to the test in this instance. The moment she found an opening, she struck back, battering his shield with one strike after the next, -
[2024-01-05 21:03:29+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - determined to burst her way. If his bunshin got in the way, it'd crumble before the onslaught. (3 hits, RED) (cont)
[2024-01-05 21:03:39+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YOWCH THAT FIRST HIT
[2024-01-05 21:03:42+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Geez
[2024-01-05 21:03:52+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: wasn't a crit at least
[2024-01-05 21:04:03+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  acknowledged the permission he was granted by 'Cadmus' with a nod of the head that came dangerously close to a bow, and was perfect in the context of Garlean hierarchy. "Adra, Okhit'to, if you would be so kind as to take the Farsent and the decurion out of here while we deal with her." He left little doubt who 'her' was, as he aimed and shot his gunblade at J'nairoh after he spoke with the calm of a trained soldier. He didn't aim to kill, though anything could happen when a gun is involved.
[2024-01-05 21:04:07+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: you know back when we did this on private servers, i always wondered if it'd be possible to hack the random dice roll system
[2024-01-05 21:04:10+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: are you doing that now, fern?
[2024-01-05 21:04:31+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I think Sven just killed Red
[2024-01-05 21:04:34+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Oops
[2024-01-05 21:04:35+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: [ hi sorry i was afk for a sec ]
[2024-01-05 21:04:37+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh no
[2024-01-05 21:05:38+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im waiting for after the (cont), let me know if im misreading it
[2024-01-05 21:05:52+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Oh, I thought the rolls were the cont
[2024-01-05 21:06:41+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: also, cont is pronounced the same as 'kont' in Dutch, which is a rude word for BUM. The more you know.
[2024-01-05 21:06:52+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YOOO we say that in england too
[2024-01-05 21:07:15+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Yuyuno scoffed at Yoki's slight. "What do you know," she growled, but there was no bite to it, all her bravado having deflated with her defeat. "Get me out of here. I don't want to be here for what's next."
[2024-01-05 21:07:17+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: well, it doesnt mean bum.
[2024-01-05 21:07:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ye wot, kont
[2024-01-05 21:07:33+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: It's always funny (or not) when languages do silly things like that to each other
[2024-01-05 21:07:37+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ill fook ye mum
[2024-01-05 21:07:42+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I'm gong to do it! I'm going to say the C word!
[2024-01-05 21:07:43+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: [breathes in]
[2024-01-05 21:08:24+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  's skin shimmers resplendently under Charlette's shield. As Luca and Yoki approach, Imogen looks peaceful, as if she's sleeping deeply — if she weren't sliding down the wall with a lolling head. A card of the major arcana spills from her pocket: the Ewer. Thaliak patiently pours water into the Lifestream, the light of Reason cast upon him. Unseen, Nymeia guides the water beyond to its fated path. Without the stars visible, it's unclear how useful such a card could be.
[2024-01-05 21:08:24+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Camembert?
[2024-01-05 21:09:47+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  immediately moves to help escorting people out, hands upturned and visible. She aids in escorting them where possible, for whoever will follow, and makes sure to steer them as clear as possible from the actual fight. Redgar should manage. Right? He's tired, but he's not down. Right?
[2024-01-05 21:09:54+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i have to step away for a sec but there's my quickiepost
[2024-01-05 21:10:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: re: cards - i use them as both raw elemental aether and/or their original buff effects back during stormblood, not the current dps-only buffing effects. so in mechanical terms, this card would be an MP buff or a water card
[2024-01-05 21:10:38+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: brooo i can barely remember that pink = ranged
[2024-01-05 21:10:50+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  staggers back as a blade tears across his throat - and dispels his bunshin, which peels off into wisps of shadow. The next hit strikes him harshly, and his barrier shatters - while the last draws an open wound at his side. [Barrier: SHATTERED.] Just as Sven's shot whizzed past - likely missing the miqo'te but giving Redgar enough time to recuperate. Well, not really - he's bleeding, but his whole life he's been Too Stubborn To Die. (1/2)
[2024-01-05 21:10:55+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: "Is that all ye've got. Fuckin' -murderer-. Temperer. I know what you are. Just a cornered fuckin' animal snapping at whatever makes you feel safe. I know 'cause I was that, and I still -am- that, if PRESSED." He lunges forward despite being completely vulnerable, abandoning his blades to try and simply -grab- her and hold her in place. "You were never a miqo'te. Garlean tip to toe. The Vipers learnt that lesson." (2/2)
[2024-01-05 21:11:03+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i barely play astrologian anymore youre valid as hell
[2024-01-05 21:11:07+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: the dice dislike me
[2024-01-05 21:11:10+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  snaps her attention back to Yuyuno. She tosses her hair. "Fashion, blue magic, and how to talk down to people. All extremely relevant here, evidently." She turns her attention back to Imogen, aiming to just try to protect her from the melee. She does offer a single burst of blue magic, ringing bells bringing restorative energies, but otherwise is mostly just there to body-block for the lancer and check her head for a wound.
[2024-01-05 21:11:20+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: RED GO IN ON HERRRR
[2024-01-05 21:11:29+00:00] Polarhine Mennarc CrossWorldLinkShell_1: HF at event friends!
[2024-01-05 21:11:44+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  carefully kneels beside Imogen, thankful - at least until he's brutalised - that Redgar has the enemy's attention. She rummages around in the bag at her side and procures a vial of blue liquid, helpfully labelled. She inspects the card that has slipped out. Oh, pretty! Important matters though. "I'm still working on the taste, sorry," she whispers, as if Imogen can hear. Then she tries to dunk the potion down the woman's throat. (Okay, she carefully pours it.)
[2024-01-05 21:12:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: luca coming in with the chug jug
[2024-01-05 21:12:11+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  tends to speak with a quiet and slightly soft tone, and even now, he doesn't raise his voice as such; it still feels to gain strength and, above anything else, a razor-sharp edge. "Stop right now or you will regret it." His warning is followed by him gathering a surge of aether and turning it into a blunt ice projectile. He sends it flying towards J'NAIROH.
[2024-01-05 21:12:18+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: WOW GAME
[2024-01-05 21:12:22+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: :x
[2024-01-05 21:12:25+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Okay.
[2024-01-05 21:12:26+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: So.
[2024-01-05 21:12:33+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i cant believe cain just died
[2024-01-05 21:12:35+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ......
[2024-01-05 21:12:39+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (Thank you Polar! Sorry you got held up tonight)
[2024-01-05 21:12:40+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I think Fern paid the devs to mess with our rolls
[2024-01-05 21:12:41+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i feel like that means she throws Red into the path of that, right
[2024-01-05 21:12:42+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: How open are you to shennanigan talks concerning spell effects being reprisented in RP Fern?
[2024-01-05 21:12:44+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I guess my next roll will be 1,2
[2024-01-05 21:12:51+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: * 1.2
[2024-01-05 21:12:52+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cos I have an idea for something. Nothing big, but it might help?
[2024-01-05 21:12:53+00:00] Luca Myste CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i could roll for potion effectiveness if wanted, since luca is still a novice
[2024-01-05 21:12:56+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Go ahead Charlette
[2024-01-05 21:13:36+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Could I, say, cast Chain Statagem on J'nairoh and if I succeed a roll attacks on her get advantage for a round or something like that?
[2024-01-05 21:14:25+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I will say yes! That sounds like a cool move so why not
[2024-01-05 21:14:38+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Yay!
[2024-01-05 21:14:58+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I feel that Guidance as a spell is just kinda made for Charlette as well. Like, that fits her personality
[2024-01-05 21:15:05+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i like the idea of luca rolling to see if her potion just makes imogen hurl
[2024-01-05 21:15:12+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: "oh no, it's got traces of peanuts in it"
[2024-01-05 21:15:17+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I will say, if you haven't realised already, attacks against Nairoh have a very high DC. I won't disclose it but although she can be struck, it'll take a good roll.
[2024-01-05 21:15:23+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LMAOOO
[2024-01-05 21:15:26+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: PEANUTS, Imogen's only weakness
[2024-01-05 21:15:32+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: roll if youd like luca and/or yoki!!
[2024-01-05 21:15:36+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: check this 1k
[2024-01-05 21:15:37+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  [Random]!  [583] 
[2024-01-05 21:15:43+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: NOT BAD
[2024-01-05 21:15:55+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: considering how everyone else is rolling, i'll take not bad
[2024-01-05 21:16:07+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: also not bad!!!
[2024-01-05 21:16:11+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (Also yes, Charlette would be a Guidance bot)
[2024-01-05 21:16:31+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: perfect, my individual rationale was 'if we can get it past the amount she went into the negatives with imo can get back up
[2024-01-05 21:19:27+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  throws a hand out towards Red as he gains the attention of their quarry, shards of barrier pulling back into place as his is shattered underneath the flurry of blows. (RED barriers +75) "So fast... unnatural." she murmurs to herself while flipping through her tome. Landing on a page she has to follow the Miqo'te's progress as she lays into Red, the glow on the page growing more and more intense until a blue bolt fires out and towards the target. If it lands, a similar coloured aura ignites -
[2024-01-05 21:19:32+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  - around her, curls into her aether, and a shadow version of herself flashes out mimicking every move she intends before she even makes it, telegraphing them for the Unsung to see. The cost on Charlette though is heavy, her strain obvious as she focuses on the effect. (Chain Statagem on J'NAIROH)
[2024-01-05 21:20:15+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: so just to be clear, when we attack we can roll twice now and take the higher number?
[2024-01-05 21:20:16+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: So everyone rolls twice on their attacks against J'nairoh and uses the highest value. Let's hope that helps!
[2024-01-05 21:20:22+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Yes!
[2024-01-05 21:20:29+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Oh, I need to roll first. Whoops!
[2024-01-05 21:20:31+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Here's hoping...
[2024-01-05 21:20:39+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Nah, no need to roll
[2024-01-05 21:20:45+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: thank you charlieeeee
[2024-01-05 21:20:49+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: OH THANK GOD, eh, FERN
[2024-01-05 21:20:54+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: FERN CANCELS IT OUT
[2024-01-05 21:20:57+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: THAT NEVER HAPPENED
[2024-01-05 21:20:58+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: IT'S FINE
[2024-01-05 21:21:09+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: bro square enix wants us dead right now
[2024-01-05 21:21:16+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 'kill these losers i want a new cast for unsung season 2'
[2024-01-05 21:21:17+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ... LOL yeah no it's just for one round and it's only once per combat I'm gonna say so let's ... ignore that lil 40
[2024-01-05 21:21:19+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Fern's roll generator is working overtime.
[2024-01-05 21:21:21+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: SE be like 'fuck RP'
[2024-01-05 21:21:26+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ferb calling yoshi p right now to make him stop giving bad dice rolls on inconsequential ones cuz it reveals their ploy
[2024-01-05 21:21:38+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: :sweat:
[2024-01-05 21:22:03+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ferb is like fern but bad because the n is replaced with b
[2024-01-05 21:22:56+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: So in my head, if Charlette does do a guidance type thing in the future, her version is just telling people what to do
[2024-01-05 21:23:00+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Ferb is the evil twin?
[2024-01-05 21:23:09+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Well. Yes.
[2024-01-05 21:23:28+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Charlette knows how to do everything. Her uM aCtUaLlY... is very powerful.
[2024-01-05 21:23:36+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: can Sven join her with that? They'll be like those old muppits talking shit
[2024-01-05 21:24:05+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Perfect.
[2024-01-05 21:24:11+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: She cancels out his mansplanning effect too.
[2024-01-05 21:24:45+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: infamous mansplainer, sven lastname
[2024-01-05 21:24:57+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Svensplainer
[2024-01-05 21:25:04+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i feel like sven does the opposite of mansplaining. he refuses to explain anything because he thinks its funny
[2024-01-05 21:25:14+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ... too accurate
[2024-01-05 21:25:18+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: manunsplaining
[2024-01-05 21:25:58+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: one day he's gonna get hit with some wicked troll's lament
[2024-01-05 21:26:03+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Coin that Imogen.
[2024-01-05 21:26:05+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: It's going places.
[2024-01-05 21:26:21+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: manabstainer
[2024-01-05 21:26:22+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i already registered it on spotify for our new podcast
[2024-01-05 21:26:28+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: THATS BETTER, DAMN IT
[2024-01-05 21:26:32+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: J'nairoh's eyes widened, her mouth fell open. There was never a hope his grapple'd succeed, but Red came closer than anyone had so far when she hesitated, missing her by a sliver. "How the fuck do you know that," she whispered under her breath, before snarling, "How the FUCK do they know that, Okhi'to!" Sven's shot cracked through the air and snapped her out of her astonishment, though. "We're screwed," she realised, backing away from him. Rather than pressing her advantage, she looked -
[2024-01-05 21:27:00+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i can fix j'nairoh
[2024-01-05 21:27:04+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: please i promise
[2024-01-05 21:27:15+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  /slap
[2024-01-05 21:27:21+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: .. deserved
[2024-01-05 21:27:37+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: its hard not to be weird around catgirls in bodysuits, i sympathize
[2024-01-05 21:28:01+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: to be honest its the super speed + the fact that shes loudly swearing
[2024-01-05 21:28:14+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: she's fast..!
[2024-01-05 21:29:50+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - past Red and leapt upward, her legwear shifting and snapping like a piston. She was above them, above... Cadmus. A sigil formed under her foot, and she kicked off against it, driving herself bodily into the illusionist's shielding. "FARSENT!" she roared as she struck; "They deceive you! Look upon the face of a TRAITOR!" she howled, as she sought to beat through Cadmus'... Cillenne's... defences until they were laid bare. (you know the drill)
[2024-01-05 21:30:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: (cont.)
[2024-01-05 21:33:32+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: can i use paladin cover on that actual big hit
[2024-01-05 21:33:52+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cadmus stood his ground until the shields burst, shattering and sending J'nairoh's weight crashing into him, pinning him to the ground. Okhi'to turned from the Unsung just in time to form another defensive barrier around the decoy decurion, but J'nairoh broke through as fast as he could form them. "Get the Farsent out!" he urged, his composure evaporating under the strain. -
[2024-01-05 21:34:07+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: no need then good
[2024-01-05 21:34:58+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: J'nairoh just gonna be laying into Cillenne this round but definitely worth considering pre-emptive/responsive defences :nod:
[2024-01-05 21:35:52+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Just to be sure, this is our 4th round yes? Been trying to keep track, but wanted to be double-sure.
[2024-01-05 21:36:23+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The Farsent were in the middle of making their way towards the only way down - a narrow set of stairs towards the far edge of the room that they'd heavily trapped to deter invaders, clearing the path as they went. They looked confused, terrified- and they hesitated, watching J'nairoh lay into her own commanding officer.
[2024-01-05 21:36:27+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i guess Celica kind of pot-committed to helping people out
[2024-01-05 21:36:40+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I think it is, yeah. Sec
[2024-01-05 21:37:05+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Yep
[2024-01-05 21:37:08+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  hissed as his gunblade, instead of shooting like it should, had a magitek failure so bad that they were lucky he didn't hit any of his allies. He had to drop the weapon as it near-exploded in his hands, wiping out his magitek shield for the umpteenth time - it didn't look like it would come back on again without maintenance. Without a weapon, all he could do to try and protect 'cadmus' was to bodily barrel into J'nairoh and, well, punch her. Classy. --
[2024-01-05 21:37:18+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Thanks!
[2024-01-05 21:37:33+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: remember you have 'advantage' here
[2024-01-05 21:37:37+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: -- He wasn't a trained unarmed fighter by any means, but he was strong and surprisingly fast, on top of being actually angry and determined to get her off 'Cadmus'. If he bodily blocked the view of some of the Farsent, all the better.
[2024-01-05 21:37:56+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: not even advantage can help me, I guess
[2024-01-05 21:39:09+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ill wait for luca and yoki before responding if thats ok with you two?
[2024-01-05 21:39:19+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  , despite his bleeding and shield status of a piddly 75, joins Sven in the melee. He's shockingly good at staying out of Sven's way while laying blows into J'nairoh, an indication that he's done this before, but with all the arms and limbs flying he might not have the right opening...
[2024-01-05 21:39:39+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: imo will get up but what they do will largely inform the context of waht she should do in her pov
[2024-01-05 21:39:51+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  messes up his previous spell when he gets caught in a coughing fit, perhaps caused by the blunt trauma he received earlier from the scorpid tank. He clicks his tongue in quiet frustration. (cont.)
[2024-01-05 21:40:00+00:00] Cain Locke Say: "Stand down, and you'll get a second chance - even though it might be more than you deserve. Continue or run, and you'll end up in a worse place than you've ever..." Cain's attempt at intimidation gets cut off by J'nairoh's roaring, and seeing Cillenne in danger makes him act on instinct. He tries to focus as much aether into an unaspected blast and force J'NAIROH to move - with hurt as a side-bonus. "Celica, and anyone who is able to! Go help the Farsent!" (Shields: 1250)
[2024-01-05 21:40:28+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: The most useless levemete of the year
[2024-01-05 21:40:34+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: CAINN T_T
[2024-01-05 21:40:41+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: fern turn the roll-nerfer off
[2024-01-05 21:40:44+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: BLESS ;_;
[2024-01-05 21:40:49+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 322 is only below average!
[2024-01-05 21:40:53+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: no u cant make me im winning hahaha
[2024-01-05 21:40:54+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I feel like Red, Cain, and I can just add our rolls together
[2024-01-05 21:41:32+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  keeps that focus on J'nairoh best she can, the blue shadows pulling out of her form before every move she makes, every blow she lays down. She finishes the channel, heaving in breaths like she'd run a mile and winded herself, toppling a little in her stance. Aether-fatigue is clear, colour partially drained from her features, but she raises her tome and a burst of light fires from between the pages, new segments of barrier being woven and thrown into the air, flying out and shoring up -
[2024-01-05 21:41:37+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  - every barrier around the Unsung, and if she can manage it, the fleeing Farsent as well. (GROUP WIDE barriers + 750)
[2024-01-05 21:41:45+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I guess in a certain way it makes sense that magic attacks aren't working, given that the place is aetherially insulated and all
[2024-01-05 21:42:34+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  pops the now empty vial back in her little hip bag, makes sure there's no spillage leaking out of Imogen's mouth (dignity is important), and then stands. "Hopefully that'll help!" Even she's not entirely sure. She turns her attention to the battle and chews her bottom lip. Will she just get in the way at this point? To heck with it! She takes a small stone out of her bag, holds it in her palm, and begins channeling it with wind magic from her rings - and with a flick, it rockets forwards,
[2024-01-05 21:42:41+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  like a bullet.
[2024-01-05 21:42:52+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Luca Wins: Murder
[2024-01-05 21:42:53+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: HEADSHOT
[2024-01-05 21:43:01+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: OMG
[2024-01-05 21:43:04+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: FORTNITE MOMENT
[2024-01-05 21:43:04+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: "On it!" Celica has dashed forward and erected her own barrier on herself, interposing herself between J'nairoh and the Farsent who are on their way down and lifting her shield, ready to prevent anything from reaching them—and to ensure their getaway with the rest of the Unsung.
[2024-01-05 21:43:08+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yooo
[2024-01-05 21:43:16+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Luca just casually kills J with a stone

[2024-01-05 21:44:27+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Who said the ant can't beat the boot sometimes.

[2024-01-05 21:44:56+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: EYYY!
[2024-01-05 21:45:01+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: GOTT'EM
[2024-01-05 21:45:55+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: who would win: A) the pinnacle of garlean power armour or, B) a cute half-elezen with a rock
[2024-01-05 21:47:04+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Rocks are just its elemental weakness, okay
[2024-01-05 21:47:28+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That's why they found the rock on the way to this boss battle
[2024-01-05 21:47:32+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath Emote:  appeared to have made some progress in her little corner. "I can get them out," she reported calmly, as if there wasn't a battle unfolding fulms away from her. "You, as well," she said, addressing Yuyuno. Starting back into the corridor from whence they came, she told the Unsung with her back to them: "I'll clear an escape route." That was that. She gestured to the Farsent to follow her - hopefully they'd feel some degree of trust towards a Garlean considering their experiences.
[2024-01-05 21:48:20+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I gotta head out in a minute, so I might take this chance to scram with Adra? not sure how that would work out for the next session of this!
[2024-01-05 21:48:41+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I can DM you about that
[2024-01-05 21:49:04+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: If you want to have her leave now but participate in next event, without spoilers, it should be possible
[2024-01-05 21:49:36+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: She can skidoodle out and come back at some stage if I can make the next session!
[2024-01-05 21:51:50+00:00] Yoki Yokiki Emote:  takes a moment to college Imogen's astrological cards, tucking them in the fighter's grip. Taking a second, she pats Imogen's head, and looks to the others. They got this. Probably. Her voice is soon to join in with Adra's giving bonus volume to the efforts to actually evacuate people... or at least get them out of this room and away from the fighting!
[2024-01-05 21:52:14+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I might linger AFK just to be able to read what's happening, but I won't be able to be an active participant! <3
[2024-01-05 21:52:27+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: All good, thanks for coming!
[2024-01-05 21:52:55+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Always nice to have Yoki on board!
[2024-01-05 21:53:04+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Thanks for coming, yeah!
[2024-01-05 21:53:43+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: take care kev!!!
[2024-01-05 21:53:47+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  stirs to see two familiar faces looking down upon her. Her eyes blink open; belatedly, she hears the melee and remembers where she is. She looks over where Luca aims her shot, and Yoki retreating, as she uses her polearm to help herself up the floor. "Thanks… Fuuuuck," she groans, watching the rest and steadying. >>
[2024-01-05 21:54:16+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: >> "She — She already knows! If you show the others—!" she yells in disbelief towards CADMUS/CILLENNE. Cain gives orders — she limp-hops with her back to the exit, then a wide, clumsy swing in J'NAIROH's general direction, missing completely in order to dissuade her from moving towards the exit with the Farsent. (75 shield (not including Charlette's yet))
[2024-01-05 21:54:54+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: hecc
[2024-01-05 21:55:28+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: damn, i was one inch away from yoki getting to have her healer moment
[2024-01-05 21:55:29+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: next time
[2024-01-05 21:55:48+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: next time!!
[2024-01-05 21:55:49+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Imogen intends to miss and scares J'nairoh so much that she slips and hurts herself anyway
[2024-01-05 21:55:57+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: OMG
[2024-01-05 21:56:29+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2:  J'nairoh's ear pivoted back a fraction of a second before Sven could plough into her. She weaved aside, then pulled away again when Redgar joined in. They couldn't land a strike against her, but in the course of avoiding them, they forced her away from Cadmus and she lost ground- along with any further opportunity to deal the illusionist harm without first breaking through their defences. When Cain joined in, ranks closed around Cillenne. Masked gaze switching between targets, she settled on -
[2024-01-05 22:00:37+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - Charlette, and made her move to coil back and leap- just as Luca's stone struck her helm's temple. The headpiece cracked, shattering into shards as the stone itself cleaved through the metal and tore a streaking path of red from her cheek into her hairline. It derailed her path of momentum, causing her to- instead of being missed by Imogen's swing, having the blow connect directly, and she spun to the ground against the wall, the back of her head clunking against the metal. -
[2024-01-05 22:01:07+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this is BRUTAL
[2024-01-05 22:02:02+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Hissing, she tried to pull herself up, but slipped. "Fucking traitors... after all we've... been through, Ok... Okhi..." she spat, glaring at the Unsung. -
[2024-01-05 22:02:12+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: David *gestures to Luca* Goliath *gestures to J'Nairoh* The wrath of GOD *Gestures to lil'rocky on the floor*
[2024-01-05 22:02:32+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LOL
[2024-01-05 22:02:44+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: who would win?
[2024-01-05 22:03:04+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: a hyper-trained, massively experienced garlean miqo'te soldier with premonitions?
[2024-01-05 22:03:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: vs
[2024-01-05 22:03:13+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: one rocky lil guy
[2024-01-05 22:03:16+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Girl power to the max: we win because we have more girls
[2024-01-05 22:03:24+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: so true cain....
[2024-01-05 22:03:25+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I mean, that doesn't even seem like a fair matchup
[2024-01-05 22:03:37+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: girls + rock = win
[2024-01-05 22:04:00+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: Luca? yeah she's getting calls from MLB for her pitching skills
[2024-01-05 22:04:05+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: klfnmjklasdfghjk MT
[2024-01-05 22:04:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: canon
[2024-01-05 22:04:09+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: just kill me now
[2024-01-05 22:04:11+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: CANON
[2024-01-05 22:04:14+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Hell hath no fury like a pebble yoted.
[2024-01-05 22:04:17+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Okhi'to had already turned away from her, but the guilt was etched into his features. He was shielding the Farsent as he helped them down, navigating the obstacles of their own making. Levandir was helping the youngest and the eldest of them, which included two miqo'te children and a duskwight girl. -
[2024-01-05 22:04:23+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I snort laughed, thanks
[2024-01-05 22:05:55+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The path was clear, but J'nairoh looked like she still had some fight left in her despite the blood trickling down her cheek and jaw, and the way one shoulder sloped awkwardly.
[2024-01-05 22:06:26+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yoki runs back in the room to cast bad breath on her
[2024-01-05 22:06:27+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  [Random]!  [278] 
[2024-01-05 22:06:46+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i wanna try something here
[2024-01-05 22:06:50+00:00] Yoki Yokiki CrossWorldLinkShell_1:  /j if that's not obvious, sry
[2024-01-05 22:06:59+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Hits everyone but J'nairoh.
[2024-01-05 22:07:15+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: omg kev
[2024-01-05 22:07:18+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sure Celica?
[2024-01-05 22:07:29+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: do we still have ADV vs her or is that gone
[2024-01-05 22:07:45+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Nay, just for that round previously
[2024-01-05 22:07:52+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  stalks towards her, drawing his pistol with vicious alacrity. There's a quake to one leg, and he's still losing blood - though the shield shimmers around his body, holding strong. "You are going to sit still so I don't have to fire this, an' then yer going to come quietly. Contrary to your belief, I've no fuckin' interest in killing ye for what you've done."
[2024-01-05 22:07:56+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: can i roll for "i have a gun"
[2024-01-05 22:08:17+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  nearly chased after her, especially since she seemed to be going for Charlette. Only when getting hit in the face by a rock, meteor style, stopped her did he change his mind and check on 'Cadmus' instead. It had been the brutal from where he was standing. "Give the fuck up already, so we don't have to kill you," he growled towards J'nairoh before focusing on 'Cadmus'.
[2024-01-05 22:08:50+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: You may roll, results may vary
[2024-01-05 22:09:00+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oof
[2024-01-05 22:09:21+00:00] Cain Locke Say: "After all you've been through, huh. How does that compare to all you've put other people through?" Cain asks as he takes a few steps forward. He glances at "Cadmus" quickly to assess his condition, and he then locks his eyes onto J'nairoh.
[2024-01-05 22:09:55+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  is genuinely shocked as her hit connects, feeling the thud jolt her shoulder. She seems apologetic, or perhaps guilty in her own way, though she has yet to voice any apology (if she ever will). The sentiment simply shines through her fists and gestures. "We don't want to… fight…"
[2024-01-05 22:10:40+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  moves to place herself between J'nairoh and the escaping Farsent, if he sees her she nods to Levandir and tries her best to help hurry people along if they allow it. Helping hands for the old, supporting cover for the small and slow, her barriers being used to keep them as safe as herself. A wave of her tome, a flash of light, shards of barrier fly towards 'Cadmus' and shores-up his shields. (Covering for FARSENT, CILLIENNE +250 barriers) "Imogen?! Don't move, you're injured."
[2024-01-05 22:10:53+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  looks awestruck at the results of her little stone trick and silently decides to bring more little rocks and pebbles with her from now on. She sheepishly dusts her hands together, and clears her throat.
[2024-01-05 22:11:39+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: "I'm f-fuh-fine!"
[2024-01-05 22:14:47+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Cadmus had taken a few hits, those the barriers just couldn't withstand. He struggled to sit up, grimacing at the effort even though no bruising visibly showed. Seeing the Farsent's eyes upon him, he waved Sven's fussing off. "Keep her there while they escape," he urged, wiping at the corner of his mouth and staring at the streak of red that painted his knuckles.
[2024-01-05 22:14:50+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  moves, now seeing that the Farsent are being properly evacuated, and positions herself close to Red. The logic: J'nairoh is hurt enough to where Celica hopes to prevent her from striking at anyone, if she were to try to lash out and not stand down, interposing herself (or using her  "Living Shadow"  to get in the way, if it came down to it) in the path of her attempts. She gives her a small shake of the head.
[2024-01-05 22:15:37+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: "It's no use. Stand down. Let us give you medical attention. Let us end this."
[2024-01-05 22:20:32+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The Farsent by then were fully committed to getting out of there. A few of them sent the Unsung uncertain looks on their way past, but with Okhi'to beside and behind them, his shields around them, and the terrified young ones to mind, they didn't question the change in plans.
[2024-01-05 22:20:36+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: -
[2024-01-05 22:25:02+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: J'nairoh paused when she caught sight of the pistol but only bared her teeth at him, defiant. It was Cain who blunted the retort she was sharpening, forcing her to bite her tongue. "You say that," she hissed. "He said... you'd say that." She struggled to straighten up, her back to the wall as she stared them down. "I can keep this up," she insisted breathlessly. "I'll take you down... one by... one... starting with you, you mouthy shite." -
[2024-01-05 22:25:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oop
[2024-01-05 22:25:17+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: J'nairoh paused when she caught sight of the pistol but only bared her teeth at him, defiant. It was Cain who blunted the retort she was sharpening, forcing her to bite her tongue. "You say that," she hissed. "He said... you'd say that." She struggled to straighten up, her back to the wall as she stared them down. "I can keep this up," she insisted breathlessly. "I'll take you down... one by... one... starting with you, you mouthy shite." -
[2024-01-05 22:27:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Kicking forward, she sought to plow through CELICA and/or her living shadow as she lunged for RED, intending to break through his barriers with a blow in pursuit of tackling him to the ground. It'd be nigh on impossible for her to avoid a bullet at that range, though- or most anything else. (CELICA, RED, RED)
[2024-01-05 22:28:00+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i am gonna cover the first hit on red
[2024-01-05 22:28:28+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i will soak on shield and soak as damage
[2024-01-05 22:28:43+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: k! get your emotes in, this is the final round
[2024-01-05 22:29:45+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  hoped that was part of the illusion, but inclined his head in agreement anyway. He didn't know how many of the Farsent were still buying this story, but he'd didn't want to find out what would happen if they were still here if the real Cadmus was coming up for a check. "You heard the decurion," he said to the ones still lingering. "Go." Only then did he acknowledge J'nairoh again, and he shook his like a disappointed father. When she lunged, he again tried to bodily slam into her, aiming to-
[2024-01-05 22:29:45+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  knocks the first strike away as it pulses against her existing barriers. The second stroke, Celica interposes herself—it breaks those barriers, but Celica prevents the hit from reaching Red, which leaves just Red's barriers and a wide open opportunity. Celica does nothing else than to march forward, shield up, and grit her teeth as J'nairoh draws blood. "You're a fool...!"
[2024-01-05 22:29:55+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Say: -- throw her off balance.
[2024-01-05 22:30:21+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: (Celica: Fine -> Wounded, barrier out.)
[2024-01-05 22:31:11+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sven's disappointment keeps me awake at night
[2024-01-05 22:32:19+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: It hurts, even when it is not because of you.
[2024-01-05 22:33:15+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  genuinely considers firing the gun as she charges - but Celica's interposing between him and her, and he lifts it up at the last second. Two strikes shattering the barrier, then slamming into Celica - then tearing into him, sneding him skidding backwards... but his barriers flicker and hold. ( 825 - 694  = 131 ) he growls, tossing the gun to the side. As Sven barrels into her he aims to capitalise, by sweeping around to her other side, flicking out a blade, and aiming a savage blow to -
[2024-01-05 22:34:36+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: - her temple with the pommel. "Thank the Vipers for your life."
[2024-01-05 22:35:06+00:00] Redgar Ashten Say: [ sending* ]
[2024-01-05 22:35:08+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  is a flurry of swears as she tries to figure out what to do. She had tried fighting, and it knocked her out. Now, there's less people on the line — hence more to shift. "You have a reason to—… you're f-f-fucking ANGRY, and I get it! We tried to trick you! Okhi'to betrayed you! You have every right to fucking hate us, and we fucking hate you too!" >>
[2024-01-05 22:35:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Say: >> "But gods damn it, there's nothing to fight for anymore! We will fight here until all of us die — is that better than leaving together and hating each other, alive?! F-Fucking surrender!" (825 shield total)
[2024-01-05 22:36:17+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  focused on helping the Farsent leave, hurrying them along even if it means she scares them along the way. "Quickly, please! Quick as you can! Deep breaths, do not linger in the tunnel." but the crunch and clatter of Celica and Red contending with J'nairoh pulls her attention. A flash from her tome, a few shards forming a thin barrier around Celica "Almost there! Keep that mad woman busy just a little longer!" (CELICA barriers +75)
[2024-01-05 22:36:45+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: "Th-thanks....!!"
[2024-01-05 22:37:18+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath Emote:  helped herd the Farsent out and down the corridor. She didn't seem to be particularly affected by the thrumming aether, but most of the escapees picked up their pace and some covered their ears on their way out.
[2024-01-05 22:37:32+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Imogen making the "This could be us, hating, but you still fighting' card.
[2024-01-05 22:37:41+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  shifts uneasily from foot to foot. She doesn't want to risk using her sword here, but nor does she have much to offer in the way of words. "Don't make me shoot an even bigger rock at you! I'll do it!" Pointless threat aside, she elects to simply linger by the exit - and her wounded ally - just in case. And look as threatening as possible. She even frowns!
[2024-01-05 22:38:29+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: luca just took the rock lee weights off
[2024-01-05 22:38:42+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: glued on the angy eyebrows
[2024-01-05 22:40:25+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  just keeps staring at J'nairoh. For a moment, it seems like he isn't going to act - but he then all of a sudden rushes forward, trying to weave his way past his Unsung comrades, and strikes J'NAIROH with an elbow (a fairly sharp one). If looks could kill, he would've slain her already, but... (Shields: 2000)
[2024-01-05 22:40:36+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YES CAIN
[2024-01-05 22:40:38+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: SLAY
[2024-01-05 22:40:42+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: coming in CLUTCH
[2024-01-05 22:41:01+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: aw im so proud of him
[2024-01-05 22:41:24+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: okay so like, we're now a team that fights with rocks and mages throwing elbows
[2024-01-05 22:41:34+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: these are the stories that go 'unsung' for a reason
[2024-01-05 22:41:46+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: If it works...
[2024-01-05 22:41:55+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That's why they call it the people's elbow
[2024-01-05 22:42:00+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 'we took down someone in a garlean power suit with cain's elbow' 'yeah, and im the warrior of light'
[2024-01-05 22:42:04+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Can't deny it, casting 'elbow' sounds even less cool than casting 'fist'
[2024-01-05 22:42:24+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: But angery
[2024-01-05 22:42:39+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: elbow is way more 'ive had enough of your shit' tbf
[2024-01-05 22:42:58+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: So this is why Cain doesn't like being touched. He's forged from concentrated danger.
[2024-01-05 22:46:45+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Bowled over by Sven's weight, J'nairoh's charge ended with a tumble into the Unsung's midst. She was vulnerable- as much as she willed her body to move, it wouldn't, not fast enough, not far enough, and knowing what was coming must've only made it hurt more when the pommel clipped the side of her head, and Cain's blow threw her to the ground, supine and winded. She groaned sharply in pain, and as she struggled to catch her breath, one of her bladed fists slipped from her fingers, and she -
[2024-01-05 22:46:52+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Moments like this remind me of how I participated in a fight club and earned the (OOC) nick name 'Cain the Pain Train'
[2024-01-05 22:47:02+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: omfg
[2024-01-05 22:48:41+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: (I got lucky maybe once or twice, but it was enough for the nickname to stick)
[2024-01-05 22:49:04+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: This needs to be something the Unsung find out at some point
[2024-01-05 22:49:09+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i wish this was canon so someone could dig up this info on him and bring it up at a starlight party
[2024-01-05 22:49:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: YES SAME BRAIN
[2024-01-05 22:50:16+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Ahaha, well, we can pretend that a random crowd used that nickname IC and it's therefore canon
[2024-01-05 22:50:52+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: 'this is our levemete' 'NO WAY, THE PAIN TRAIN?' [everyone: ????]
[2024-01-05 22:51:04+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: - turned it back against her palm. She lifted her hand over her chest, the edge of its blade turned inward, and her gaze upon it. "I'm not- I'm not going-" she started to stammer--and the ground under their feet SHUDDERED. A tremor coursed through the facility, causing the walls, the floor, the ceiling to creak dangerously, as if screaming under the strain. -
[2024-01-05 22:51:14+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cain: /o\
[2024-01-05 22:51:19+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: oh fuck
[2024-01-05 22:51:25+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: we are all gonna die
[2024-01-05 22:51:26+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Uh oh...
[2024-01-05 22:51:26+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: The lights flickered- and winked out.
[2024-01-05 22:51:36+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2024-01-05 22:51:38+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: NOT THE APARTMENT LIGHTS
[2024-01-05 22:51:43+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: FERN
[2024-01-05 22:51:48+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: GRABBING YOU GRABBING YOU SHAKING YOU
[2024-01-05 22:51:50+00:00] Luca Myste CrossWorldLinkShell_1: im scared
[2024-01-05 22:52:04+00:00] Celica Ashworth Say: "... Well, this isn't good," comes the quip.
[2024-01-05 22:52:23+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_2: Roll +800 to stay on your feet. )
[2024-01-05 22:52:31+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Fern forgot to pay the bills
[2024-01-05 22:52:34+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: There's a random Garlean grunt flicking the light switch on and off "OoOoOoOoOoO."
[2024-01-05 22:52:35+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  is on her ass.
[2024-01-05 22:52:41+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: LETS GO
[2024-01-05 22:52:42+00:00] Celica Ashworth Emote:  is saying that from the floor.
[2024-01-05 22:53:06+00:00] Cain Locke Emote:  gets caught by surprise and falls, his weapon slipping from his grasp and clattering onto the floor.
[2024-01-05 22:53:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten Emote:  roars a: "COWARD!" just as the lights go out - the anger's probably what makes him stay on his feet.
[2024-01-05 22:53:18+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: And that's where we're gonna call it for tonight :D
[2024-01-05 22:53:25+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: what
[2024-01-05 22:53:26+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: AWAAAA

[2024-01-05 22:53:51+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cadmus is just like "fuck i forgot to pay my energy bills"
[2024-01-05 22:53:51+00:00] Luca Myste Emote:  has spent a considerable amount of time on airships, so sudden movement and jerking is nothing new to her. She ably leans and stays upright. "Ack!"
[2024-01-05 22:53:51+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: holy bruh
[2024-01-05 22:53:55+00:00] Luca Myste CrossWorldLinkShell_1: very cool thank you
[2024-01-05 22:53:55+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: "cost of living crisis, what can ya do"
[2024-01-05 22:54:04+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i DONT WANT TO GO INTO THE CADMUS FLOOR
[2024-01-05 22:54:05+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: If Sven doesn't fall on top of her in spite, I don't wanna RP anymore
[2024-01-05 22:54:06+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: anyways im on the floor now and this sucks and its dark
[2024-01-05 22:54:06+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: HELP
[2024-01-05 22:54:19+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sven are you seriously doing the anime thing rn
[2024-01-05 22:54:21+00:00] Charlette Bellamy Emote:  was about to do her little light-seeds trick but the shuddering knocks her off balance and sends her toppling to the ground with a yelp.
[2024-01-05 22:54:49+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yeah and then his shirt flings open from the fall and his boobs fly out
[2024-01-05 22:54:54+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: kyaaa
[2024-01-05 22:54:55+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: wow.....
[2024-01-05 22:54:57+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ok but make it canon
[2024-01-05 22:55:09+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: defeating garlemald with the power of ecchi
[2024-01-05 22:55:12+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: that's what it's called, right
[2024-01-05 22:55:15+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: is he falling on her in like a sexy way?? perfect
[2024-01-05 22:55:18+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Agreed, thanks for DMing, Fern! I might even forgive you for cheating with the rolls due to how intense this turned out
[2024-01-05 22:55:20+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: or is it yuri. is sven yuri, this is the equestion
[2024-01-05 22:55:24+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: k-kyaa, sven san....!
[2024-01-05 22:55:30+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine Emote:  clatters to the ground and holds for dear life onto her weapon.
[2024-01-05 22:55:33+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: sven could be yuri maybe
[2024-01-05 22:55:43+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: sven and adra are toxic yuri
[2024-01-05 22:55:47+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: is what's happening with j'nairoh just all weird yuri of longing
[2024-01-05 22:56:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: idk maybe red and her could be friends to lovers
[2024-01-05 22:56:12+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this is a joke, he kinda thinks she sucks
[2024-01-05 22:56:18+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: ... enemies to lovers*
[2024-01-05 22:56:34+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: enemies to friends to enemies to lovers to friends with benefits to enemies again
[2024-01-05 22:56:34+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: I was about to say, Red has some weird qualifications for friends
[2024-01-05 22:56:35+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath Emote:  /almost/ managed to stay on his feet, and then he didn't. Damned floor trembles. Or earthquakes - who knows?
[2024-01-05 22:56:39+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Red's tier list of these guys would put her at the bottom and Okhi'to at the top
[2024-01-05 22:56:48+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sven just wants that suit
[2024-01-05 22:56:53+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Glad you had fun! If I'd gotten a chain of <100 rolls I imagine the danger'd have been a bit of a joke but I wanted to let RNG balance J'nairoh's mechanics a bit
[2024-01-05 22:56:55+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: he's gonna get one for himself now
[2024-01-05 22:57:08+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: nah it was cool, hammered home how scary some of these guys are
[2024-01-05 22:57:09+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: He'll have a little drawing of it, begging Adra to make it
[2024-01-05 22:57:09+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: she was a fun fight genuinely
[2024-01-05 22:57:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i loved getting KO'd in one round unironically
[2024-01-05 22:57:16+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Thanks for DMing Fern. This was excellent! Lot's of fun, please don't kill our characters next time.
[2024-01-05 22:57:17+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: plus the Unsung is -not- well rested
[2024-01-05 22:57:20+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: That'd be, as they say, a dick move.
[2024-01-05 22:57:22+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: it makes sense they'd have trouble
[2024-01-05 22:57:27+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: so next time you go on an adventure with him, he'll be a skin tight magitek suit. Prepare
[2024-01-05 22:57:38+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: True this! Also I like the idea of skinsuits for the Unsung
[2024-01-05 22:57:44+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: feels like i'm wearing nothing at all!
[2024-01-05 22:57:44+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: pls go do pvp ok?
[2024-01-05 22:57:45+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: nothing at all!
[2024-01-05 22:57:47+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: nothing at all!
[2024-01-05 22:58:20+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: i would go to Unsung school if this was the uniform [skinsuit] this was the teacher [cain the pain train] and this was the subject [cringe]
[2024-01-05 22:58:34+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Charlette would wear clothes over her skin suit. With a high collar.
[2024-01-05 22:58:36+00:00] Redgar Ashten CrossWorldLinkShell_1: also, brb
[2024-01-05 22:58:44+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: And never be able to look at people. Ever.
[2024-01-05 22:59:30+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Just staring upwards, trying to hand out pants.
[2024-01-05 23:00:00+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Cain teaching cringe would be fantastic
[2024-01-05 23:00:09+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Talk about defence against the dark arts
[2024-01-05 23:00:10+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: OMG I DIDNT MEAN IT THAT WAY
[2024-01-05 23:00:15+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: T_T
[2024-01-05 23:00:24+00:00] Cain Locke CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Haha no worries, Cain can be a bit cringe at times
[2024-01-05 23:00:26+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: youre too hater to live fern...
[2024-01-05 23:00:29+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: the only person who was sort of not that hurt was Celica, who only got scorpion smacked, and she just spent a lot of that "still sort of OK" on J'nairoh, soooo
[2024-01-05 23:01:01+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: You're gonna all start the next fight with 3 levels of exhaustion
[2024-01-05 23:01:07+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Fun!
[2024-01-05 23:01:22+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Do we get to roll for broken ankles due to falling before the event starts too?
[2024-01-05 23:01:30+00:00] Adra Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Roll for sprains
[2024-01-05 23:01:30+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: we get negative shield
[2024-01-05 23:01:49+00:00] Sven Cloudwrath CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sven's ankles are too manly to need a check
[2024-01-05 23:02:06+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Sturdy mankles.
[2024-01-05 23:02:20+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: alright gamers
[2024-01-05 23:02:21+00:00] Charlette Bellamy CrossWorldLinkShell_1: Is that why he flashes them so much?
[2024-01-05 23:02:30+00:00] Celica Ashworth CrossWorldLinkShell_1: this bundle of armor is gonna head off for a bit to snag Comida
[2024-01-05 23:02:40+00:00] Imogen Lafontaine CrossWorldLinkShell_1: yeee i gotta go since i got a haircut to get tomorrow
